# TTY-Golf
To The Tee

A simple game of golf in which the user chooses a course, club and putt power and proceeds to play. The program calculates the distance covered by the shot based on the
mean and standard deviation values of the putt and club chosen. It then prompts them of their progress and distance to the finish.  

This program can be run on the terminal or IDLE and doesn't require any run configurations.
