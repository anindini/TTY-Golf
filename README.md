# TTY-Golf
To The Tee

A simple game of golf in which the user has to choose a course, club and putt power and proceed to play. The program calculates the distance covered by the shot based on the
mean and standard deviation values of the putt power. It will then prompt them of their progress and how far they are from the finish. 

This program can be run on the terminal or IDLE and doesn't require any run configurations.
